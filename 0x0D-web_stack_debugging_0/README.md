## **0x0D-web_stack_debugging_0**
The Webstack debugging series will train you in the art of debugging. Computers and software rarely work the way we want.

In this debugging series, broken/bugged webstacks will be given to you, the final goal is to come up with a Bash script that once executed, will bring the webstack to a working state.

### ****
In this first debugging project, you will need to get Apache to run on the container and to return a page containing 'Hello Holberton' when querying the root of it

**curl** the port 8080 mapped to the Docker container port 80, it does not return a page but an error message

After connecting to the container and fixing whatever needed to be fixed (here is your mission), you can see that curling port 80 return a page that contains Hello Holberton. Paste the command(s) you used to fix the issue in your answer file
